        <h2>Chapter 1 – The Hospital</h2>
       <p>Chapter 1 – The Hospital</p>
     <p>I woke up in a small room. The walls were white and cold. The bed was hard, and the blanket smelled strange. I tried to remember how I got here. My head hurt, and everything felt heavy.</p>
     <p>A woman sat in a chair near the window. She had a notebook and a pen. Her face was calm, but her eyes were kind. She smiled a little and said,</p>
      <p>“Good morning, Yasmin. I am Dr. Selma. Can you tell me how you feel?”</p>
     <p>I looked at her and tried to speak, but the words stuck in my throat. I felt scared and confused. Everything was quiet except the sound of the clock ticking.</p>
     <p>“I… I don’t know,” I finally said. “I feel… lost.”</p>
      <p>Dr. Selma nodded slowly. “That is okay. We can take it slowly. Start from the beginning. Tell me what happened before you came here.”</p>
       <p>I closed my eyes. Memories came back, like a storm in my head. My friends… Adam, Ons, Dorra, Rachid… something happened to them. They disappeared. I didn’t know where they were.</p>
        <p>I wanted to help them. I wanted to find them. But I felt so small, so weak. I didn’t understand why bad things were happening. I felt alone.</p>
     <p>Dr. Selma waited quietly. I felt like I had to tell her everything, but I didn’t know where to start. So I took a deep breath and began:</p>
     <p>“It all started after… Everything changed at home. My aunt… Fatma… She is not like other people. She is… cold. She yells. She doesn’t care about feelings. And then…”</p>
      <p>I stopped. I didn’t want to cry in front of her. But the memories were strong. I wanted to tell someone. Finally, I whispered,</p>
      <p>“…then my friends started to disappear.”</p>
     <p>Dr. Selma nodded. She didn’t say anything, just wrote in her notebook. Her silence made me feel safe. Maybe… maybe I could tell her everything.</p>
     <p>And that is how my story began.</p>

         <p>Chapter 2 – Life with Aunt Fatma</p>
     <p>Life at home with Aunt Fatma was not easy. She was strict and cold. She never smiled. Every day, she reminded me that I had to be perfect. If I made a small mistake, she would yell, sometimes for a long time. Once, I dropped a cup of tea, and she locked me in my room for two hours. I sat on the floor and listened to her steps outside. My heart beat fast. I wanted to disappear.</p> 
     <p>Fatma never asked about my feelings. She said feelings were weak. “You must be strong, Yasmin,” she said. “Life is not kind to weak people.” But I did not feel strong. I felt small, lonely, and scared.</p>
        <p>I missed my parents. They died when I was ten. Everyone said it was an accident, a car crash. People around me cried and moved on. I tried to cry too, but it felt empty. Sometimes I pretended to be okay, because I was afraid Fatma would notice my sadness and use it against me.</p>
        <p>I learned to be quiet. I read books, wrote little notes to myself, and spent time in my room. I even talked to my parents in my mind, asking them to protect me. I kept these thoughts secret. They were mine.</p>
     <p>Sometimes Fatma would say things that confused me. “You must be careful who you trust,” she would say. I thought she meant strangers, but later, I realized she meant everyone, even friends. It made me careful with my words.</p>
     <p>Even though life was hard at home, I tried to keep hope alive. I held on to memories of my parents and small dreams that one day, things could be different.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 3 – My Friends</h2>
       
       
       <p>I had four friends. They were my world, my safe place outside the walls of my aunt’s house.</p>
       <p>Adam was strong and serious. He seemed older than he was. He protected me in small ways,<br> like walking me home when it got dark, or making sure I ate when I skipped meals. <br>Sometimes he argued with us, but I knew he only wanted what was best.</p>
       <P>Ons was kind. She smiled even when she was sad. She listened to everything I said. <br>I liked her because she made me feel safe. <br>She always seemed to understand things that others missed.</P>
       <p>Dorra was artistic. She loved to tell stories and draw pictures of strange, magical worlds. Her imagination sometimes scared me, but I loved listening to her. She was dramatic and emotional, but she always made me laugh when I was sad.</p>
       <p>Rachid was smart and funny. He could make anyone laugh, even in bad moments. He solved problems easily and helped us when we were confused. He made the group feel complete.We shared many secrets and adventures. We spent almost every day together. We laughed, cried, and promised to stay friends forever. We trusted each other more than anyone else.</p>
       <P>But there was one secret we never told anyone, not our parents, not even our teachers. When we were younger, we accidentally caused a fire in an old shed near our neighborhood. We were curious and did not know it could be dangerous. Someone got hurt in that fire, and we panicked. We helped hide the truth and swore never to speak about it again.</P>
       <P>That secret weighed on all of us. We were afraid of being found out. It was a heavy, dark memory that followed us everywhere. Yet, we tried to forget it and act normal.I loved my friends, and I trusted them completely. I thought nothing could ever separate us. But soon, everything would change, and that secret would become more dangerous than I could imagine.</P>

  <h2>Chapter 4 – The First Strange Letter</h2>

  <p>One morning, something strange happened. I found a letter on my doorstep. There was no name, no address. I picked it up carefully. It was unusual, neat, and written in a hand I did not know.</p>

  <p>The letter said:</p>

  <p><em>“If you want to speak to the ones you’ve lost, follow the signs. Your friends can help you remember.”</em></p>

  <p>At first, I did not understand it. I wondered if it was a prank or a mistake. Who would send me a letter like this? But deep inside, I felt a spark of hope. I hoped that maybe, somehow, I could speak to my parents again.</p>

  <p>I held the letter close and read it again. It promised that if I followed its instructions, I could hear my parents’ voices. I did not know how. I did not know if it was real. I only knew I wanted to try.</p>

  <p>I kept the letter hidden from Aunt Fatma. I did not trust her. She would have laughed at me or scolded me. I wanted someone to help me, someone who would not make fun of my grief.</p>

  <p>Over the next few days, I looked at the letter many times. I thought about my parents, about my friends, and about everything I had lost. I wanted to believe it.</p>

  <p>Then I started noticing small signs, little things that felt like messages, like coincidences. A word in a book, a song on the radio, even the way my friends said something. It made me think maybe the letter was real.</p>

  <p>I wanted to share it with someone, but I could not. It was too strange, too personal. It was mine, and mine alone. I did not know that keeping this secret would lead to something I could never imagine.</p>

  <p>And that was the start of everything.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 5 – Adam Disappears</h2>

  <p>It was a quiet evening when I realized Adam was missing. He had not come home after school, and his phone went straight to voicemail. At first, I thought he might be angry with me or Ons. But then hours passed, and I felt a cold fear in my stomach.</p>

  <p>I ran to his house. His parents were worried, talking to neighbors and the police. I tried to stay calm. “Maybe he stayed at a friend’s house?” I said, but inside, my heart was pounding.</p>

  <p>I wanted to do something. I could not just sit and wait. I started looking for him around town, asking people if they had seen him. No one had.</p>

  <p>That night, I could not sleep. I kept thinking about the letter I had found weeks ago. Could it be connected? It sounded crazy, but I could not stop wondering.</p>

  <p>I wrote in my notebook: <em>Find Adam. Don’t wait. He is my friend. He is my family now.</em></p>

  <p>I did not know what would happen next, but I promised myself I would not give up.</p>
